<!-- In this response provide an example of a kind of image that would be read differently if it were seen in another medium (for example, posts by Instagram 'influencers', food photography, or click-bait news articles). What are the 'three messages' (as laid out by Barthes) this kind of image contains? -->

<img src="https://media-assets-01.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-serena_williams_ig_feed_85682--default--1280.jpg" alt="Nike Ad" width="550" height="700">

<p>
The example I'm giving is a Nike ad with a picture of Serena Williams and a caption "If they think your dreams are crazy, show them what crazy dreams can do." If this was seen in a different medium like Instagram people would just scroll right past it and not give it much thought because there's ads like this all the time. On the other hand if it was seen in a stadium, like on the big screen, then people would probably view it as inspiring or get them excited for whatever game they're watching.

The three messages that Barthes explains are Linguistic, Coded, and Non-Coded messages. In this ad, the linguistic message is the caption saying "If they think your dreams are crazy, show them what crazy dreams can do." It gives the reader the sense that just because a dream you may have seems crazy or impossible to people, it doesn't mean it's unattainable and encourages them to achieve their dreams and prove people wrong. The coded message is that Serena Willams, a very good tennis player, is mid serve and about to hit a tennis ball wearing nike apparel further representing them. The non-coded message would be that a women is playing tennis. The combination of these three elements leads the reader to think that maybe Serena Williams is the person who said the caption or quote and makes the reader think that she's giving inspiring advice or that she's successful because of this mentality.
