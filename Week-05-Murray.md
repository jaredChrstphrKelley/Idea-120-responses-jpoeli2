<h2> Murray Response </h2>
<!-- In this file discuss if you believe Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. How does Murray's prediction compare to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabit while acting? Name and discuss the different layers of 'reality' both the actors and the viewers experience in the production.

Murray’s prediction with the merging of the computer, TV, and phone into one is spot. The only difference is that it was really just the phone that turned into a portable computer and TV in your pocket.
She's right about people not really watching tv anymore now that there are streaming services that allow you to watch whatever you want whenever you want. She also predicted a more interactive virtual environment that people could explore and find more about the story and lore. I don’t think this type of stuff has become as mainstream, but it does happen in some ways. There’s some TV shows that I haven’t seen yet, but they do stuff like creating virtual events that allow the audience to explore a 3d environment or solve puzzles relating to the story. An example would be a show on HBO called Lovecraft Country and they had an event recently where about 100 people were allowed to participate in a virtual reality world related to the TV show. Another example is also on HBO called Westworld, and they also have a VR thing except it can be played whenever, while Lovecraft is limited event and they are doing another one in October. <br>

When she describes the interactivity between a show and its community I can’t help but think about a video game that's coming out and the developers sent boxes to several youtubers and they had to livestream themselves unboxing what’s inside and solve whatever puzzle was there with the help of the community. An example is what it’s like is that there could be an old tape that relates to the main story and has little easter eggs they have to find in order to get to the next puzzle or code to decipher. I think these sort of things are really cool because it involves the audience and gets them excited for the release of the game. Here is one website out of the many that they got lead to: <a href="https://pawntakespawn.com/tv">Link</a>, and you can click on tapes to watch them and go to another site by clicking on the arrow on the left of the screen.

Murray also mentions tv shows having a chat room, but that’s only been done with streaming sites like twitch or youtube, so she was half right.
TV shows or movies with an interactive element where the viewer can take an active role in the plot and story doesn’t really exist except for one movie I know called Black Mirror Bandersnatch. In this movie you can make choices that lead to different endings. I think Murray is still right in a sense because even though there aren’t that many, there’s still one mainstream movie that fits her description, but also many more games that also fit that description. Games have evolved in a way that they have become a medium for a story to be told and you can have more of an interactive role in the story.

At the end when she says we won’t think about the medium we are experiencing something through, like not thinking about if something is a theatrical set or a computer generated image. This is the one part that made me think of the Mandalorian virtual set and I think her prediction of virtual environments is very close. There aren’t random people creating a story in an rpg world, but there is a virtual set that an actor can use to best perform. I don’t think anyone could tell that this was filmed on a virtual set when watching it, so the fact that we can’t tell falls right into her prediction that we won’t be thinking about the medium they use to film and give a story because the medium completely melts away as we experience it. I think the actor probably feels like they really are in this fantasy environment, but it still feels like any other tv show for an audience member because there isn’t much that has changed on that end. I think there’s potential for stuff like HBO is doing with their tv shows, making vr experiences related to the show. This would be easier to do because the environments are already made in Unreal Engine because they used that to make the virtual sets.
