<h2> Green Screen Project Proposal </h2>
<!--
 -->

<p>
For this project I was thinking of using a 3d software, but I don't know if that's allowed. I wanted to create my normal working space, but make alter and change dramatically, but I only know how to do that in a 3d software that I use. If I can't use it then I was thinking of making my background the inside of a car that's driving around the world.
