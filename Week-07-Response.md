<h2> Week 7 Response </h2>
<!--
discuss in about 3 paragraphs what methods outlined by O'Neil, Chalabi, and Gayomali you believe you're subject to when using tools and consuming media on the internet. Would the internet be more useful and egalitarian without these methods (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design), or is it useful to direct users because your message could otherwise be lost among the sea of online content?

Regarding what Chalabi said about statistics, I do think that if the data were given to us without exaggeration, misinformation, or bias then we would be able to think for ourselves a little more, but I don't think a lot of people want to analyze every piece of statistics they come across. People want to be given information in a short amount of time and by someone they trust, so I don't think people would be as engaged if they had to sift through data and figure out how the data was captured and under what circumstances because that takes a lot of time and effort. I think what would be best is to not just take information from one source because they could be biased somehow, and instead, take data from different sources so you get to see it from multiple points of view and come to your own understanding of some statistics that were thrown in your face.

In the article about typefaces, I'm a little skeptical about how a student consistently got a better grade when he wrote in Georgia because that leaves too much room for other variables, like his performance on the papers and the different grading of the teachers. So, I guess I don't believe that it works to that extent, but I do think that fonts have an effect on people because the medium is the message and everything. That's I don't think that standardizing all writing to one font would do any good because it is an extension of the message of what is being told.

Personally, I don't really mind the targeted ads that much, because I don't pay much attention to ads to begin with, but I think having things steam lined to you based on what you like or have looked up is useful because it makes it easier to find more stuff like it. In this case, I'm not really thinking about ads, I'm thinking about Youtube because if their wasn't an algorithm that gives you more videos that are similar to the ones that you watch, then you would be lost in the sea of content. It would be like when you look for a show to watch on Netlix for a long time and then end up watching nothing because you can't find anything that peeked your interest, but it would be worse on Youtube there's an endless amount of videos. Sometimes the recommend system is annoying though because you could watch something that's completely out of the ordinary and then it gives you more that, messing up your flow of content.
