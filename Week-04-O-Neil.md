<h2> O'Neil Response </h2>

<!-- Give an example in about 3 paragraphs of a "WMP" as O'Neil describes it -->

<body>  

<p>  I think an example a WDM could be the draft system in sports or how teams trade players because I think it's similar to the teacher example O'Neil gave. In sports you need the best combination of players and skill sets to even have a chance at winning a championship, so they have to be very particular about the players they bring onto the team. However, a system that evaluates only on numbers and who scores the most isn't always the best option for every situation. Like in the teacher WDM it fired all the teachers that had poor numbers regardless of if there was other valid reasons or anomalies. I think the system in sports does this often where they only focus on players that put up big numbers and that makes them more marketable, so teams trade for them while not taking into account the other variables that could've made that player good. There could have been a really good chemistry behind the players that allowed for them to play well or maybe the coach knew how to utilize the players the best for the game plan they were running. So if a player is just blindly traded for the numbers they were putting up then that just sets the team up for failure. </p>

<p> Another point is that this system overlooks the players that are doing all the dirty work or orchestrating the team so that the player can shine. An example could be the Bulls with Jordan and Pippen. Jordan was the star of course, but without Denis Rodman or Pippen it was much harder for him to put up points because they did a lot of the dirty work, like rebounding or passing the ball to him. Denis Rodman has some of the most weirdest stats in the history of Basketball with sometimes no points scored, but a lot of rebounds, so he was probably often overlooked by teams. That team had a whole flow that worked for them and allowed for the team to succeed, but without the jobs each player had and the chemistry their success would be limited. So, given that a good team clearly needs multiple kinds of skill sets and jobs, it isn't a very idea to only take into account the stats of a player when drafting or trading.  </p>
