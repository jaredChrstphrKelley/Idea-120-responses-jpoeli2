<title>Contemporary tools for Gesamtkunstwerk</title>

<!-- I watch a lot of stuff about visual effects and film, so that's where I got my tools for Gesamtkunstwerk from. -->
 
<p>In this day in age I believe a contemporary tool that can be used to create Gesamtkunstwerk is Computer Graphics, not because I personally find this field interesting,<br>  
but because it's already being used in many different mediums. It's currently being used in video games, film, tv shows, commercials and more. An example of how it's<br>  
being used in tv shows is the mandalorian because they use Unreal Engine, which is a game engine, to create a virtual set. So, instead of needing to go outside and find<br>  
a perfect environment or wait for the perfect lighting, they can manipulate the virtual world however they want, which is creatively liberating because they have control<br>  
over things that wouldn't be possible in the past and can transform the way shows and movies are made in the future. Computer Graphics itself needs multiple artists that<br>  
are in there own categories like animators, modelers, environment artists, and lighting artists, so I think this  field alone creates art that makes use of multiple art forms.</p>   

<p>Another example of a tool could be motion tracking which is a suit that has little accelerometers on it that track the person's movements onto a virtual character.<br>  
This gives people the option to properly capture an actor's performance and put it in a digital world, which is what a lot of movies and video games do. One more tool I<br>    
I can think of is virtual reality it immerses you into another world that you can interact with. I think VR is a tool for creating an immersive experience and uses things like<br>  
environment design, sound, and game design to create that, so I think virtual reality qualifies as a tool for Gesamtkunstwerk</p>
