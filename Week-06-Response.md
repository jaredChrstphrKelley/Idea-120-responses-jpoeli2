I completely agree that the content on youtube kids not being monitored like it normally would on a tv show or something is scary because the kids could see something that's extremely innapropriate or even traumatizing. Something that came to mind while I was reading this was the momo video that came up a few years ago I think. I never saw it, but I saw a picture of what it was and it even made me uneasy and creeped out, so the fact that it was seen by and geared to kids is terrible. I don't know what the video, but I think it was along the lines of telling the kids to do something or else something will happen to them, and this just makes me think about the possibilities of how children could be coerced into doing something dangerous because they were told it was safe or because they were scared. The fact that they can be exposed to stuff like this is scary really makes me wonder what the right decision is to counter this type of content from reaching kids.

I think maybe a solution could be that parents just have to be more picky about what their kids are subscribed to and positive that they are safe to watch. Youtube could implement something only on Youtube Kids that only lets them watch what they are subscribed to and have the algorithm be more restrictive with the horror and violent content. Another solution could be that certain channels are labeled with something that legitifies that channel and holds to similar regulations as kids shows on tv that make it safe to watch for kids because content made for kids shouldn't be made by just anybody. This would make it the easiest for parents and kids to find channels that are safe to watch because there could be a filter or something that only lets those channels be seen. But that process can't be automated by some algorithm because channels would find a way to slip by and it would be no different from the verified mark on a channel, which means nothing.
